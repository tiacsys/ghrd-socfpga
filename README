Status:
   v18.1

Import instructions:
   When we import GHRD from all the multiple origins we manually rework and
   qualify most of all the original code and provide this complete new file
   and directory structure.

Purpose:
   SOC abstraction layer used by SOCFPGA based boards.

Description:
   GHRD is a reference design for System On Chip (SoC) FPGA. The GHRD works
   together with Golden Software Reference Design (GSRD) for complete solution
   to Zephyr, U-Boot and Linux with SoC Development boards.

Dependencies:
   Depends on Zephyr itself as it utilizes Zephyr's APIs to provide an
   abstraction to ghrd-socfpga, especially DTS. You will need Quartus Prime
   software installed in the host PC.
